You can also see a demo on my site: http://selfboot.cn/aboutme.html .

## Usage

It's extremely easy to use, firstly you need to include the JavaScript and CSS files into your HTML:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://github.com/xuelangZF/GithubCard/blob/master/github_card.css">
<script src="https://github.com/xuelangZF/GithubCard/blob/master/github_card.js"></script>
```

then with the following single line.

```
<div id="github-usercard" user="xuelangZF"></div>
```

Here `id` must be **github-usercard**, and user should be your login name (not the nickname).
